# **Monte Carlo Simulation in QCD**

This repository contains the notebook **`Montecarlo_QCD.ipynb`**, which implements a simple Monte Carlo generator for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) processes. The notebook provides a step-by-step demonstration of how to sample physical distributions, compute observables, and visualize results within the QCD framework.

The notebook studies the simpler case of SU(2), which permits to see typical QCD features such as confinement and symptotic freedom. The goal of the project was to reproduce the results from:

Michael Creutz, Monte Carlo Study of Quantized SU(2) Gauge Theory, Physical Review D, vol. 21, no. 8, pp. 2308–2315, 1980.

Lastly, one can also find my report for this small project and my results.

## **📌 Overview**

The notebook includes:

* Random generation of events following QCD-motivated probability distributions
* Implementation of probability density functions and kinematic weights
* Use of the acceptance–rejection (hit-or-miss) algorithm
* Simulation of basic QCD observables such as:

  * energy distributions
  * angular distributions
  * invariant-mass distributions
* Visualization of all generated observables using `matplotlib`

This project is intended as an educational tool and a minimal working example of Monte Carlo techniques applied to particle physics.

## **📊 Output**

The notebook generates:

* Histograms of sampled variables
* Visual comparisons between theoretical and Monte Carlo–generated distributions
* Numerical summaries of the simulation

## **🎯 Purpose**

This project demonstrates:

* how Monte Carlo algorithms can be used to model QCD-like processes
* how to sample non-trivial distributions
* how to visualize and interpret generated physical observables

It can be used as a template or baseline for more advanced simulators, such as parton showers or full event generators.
